## Reference Material:

+ **Teaching Pronunciation a Course Book and Reference Guide:** This book includes a great CD and explanations as well as many examples of sample material that can be used in the classroom. Celce-Murcia, M., Brinton, D., & Goodwin, J. (2010). Teaching pronunciation : A course book and reference guide (2nd ed.). New York: Cambridge University Press.

+ **Teaching American English Pronunciation:** This book includes great explanations and tutorial on teaching pronunciation in the classroom. However, the most valuable section of this book for me is the common examples of learner errors based on their L1 background. Avery, P., & Ehrlich, S. (1992). Teaching American English pronunciation (Oxford handbooks for language teachers). Oxford: Oxford University Press.
